# Using-Drumbeats-to-Control-the-Lights

In this project, we have an idea about using the music created in Max to control something.
And LED lights are a direct way to show the change of the music. So we chose this to
visualize music, and also added “diamond” stuff to give the lights more scattering to look
fancy. The data transfer between them is based on Arduino.
